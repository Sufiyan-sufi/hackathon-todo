## Prompt

# Feature Specification: Mark as Complete

## Overview
Implement a function to toggle the completion status of an existing task in the in-memory Todo list by ID. This is the fifth basic level feature for Phase I, enabling users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

## Data Model
Reference: specs/data_model.md (shared across features)
- Class: Task
  - id: int (identifier for marking)
  - title: str
  - description: str
  - completed: bool (toggle this field)

The in-memory storage is a list[Task] in the main app module, shared with other features.

## Requirements
- Command: 'complete <id>' or 'mark <id>' (CLI input parsing, id as integer; toggle current status)
- Validate ID exists in list; if not, handle gracefully
- Toggle completed bool (True if incomplete, False if complete)
- Output confirmation: "Task marked as {complete/incomplete}: ID {id} - {title}"
- Integrate with existing list (find by ID, modify in place)

## Quality Gates (per Constitution Principle 5)
- Type-safe with full hints (e.g., def mark_complete(tasks: list[Task], task_id: int) -> None)
- Error handling: Raise ValueError if ID not found, print user-friendly message (e.g., "Task ID not found")
- Clean code: PEP 8, simple toggle logic, docstring for function
- Testable: Function modifies list in place, toggles correctly on multiple calls

## Agent Usage (per Constitution Principle 2)
- Generated by Spec Orchestrator Agent, refined by Spec Refiner Subagent
- Invoke skill validate_spec to check completeness before code generation

## Implementation Notes for Claude Code
- Use Python 3.13+, no external deps
- Assume tasks list is passed as param (for modularity)
- No additional params needed; just toggle existing completed field
- Refine this spec if Claude output is incorrect

This spec is approved for code generation.

## Response snapshot

Created specification for "Mark as Complete" feature with the following outcomes:

1. **Branch Created**: `001-mark-complete`
2. **Specification File**: `/mnt/d/GIAIC/Todo App/hackathon-todo/specs/001-mark-complete/spec.md`

The specification includes:
- 2 user stories (P1: Mark task complete, P2: Handle non-existent ID)
- 5 functional requirements covering toggle logic, validation, and confirmation
- 3 edge cases identified (non-existent ID, toggle back, zero/negative IDs)
- Key entity definition (Task with id, title, description, completed fields)
- 4 measurable success criteria all passing validation

All checklist validation items passed:
- No implementation details in spec
- Technology-agnostic success criteria
- Testable and unambiguous requirements
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

Feature is ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.

## Outcome

- Impact: ✅ Specification created for Mark as Complete feature with complete user scenarios, requirements, edge cases, and success criteria. Ready for planning phase.
- Tests: No tests run (spec phase - code not yet implemented)
- Files: Created specs/001-mark-complete/spec.md and specs/001-mark-complete/checklists/requirements.md
- Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to generate architecture and implementation plan
- Reflection: Specification is clear, complete, and validation passed. No clarifications needed from user.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All checklist items validated successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None - proceed to planning phase
