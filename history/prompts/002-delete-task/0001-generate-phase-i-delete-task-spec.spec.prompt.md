## Prompt

# Feature Specification: Delete Task

## Overview
Implement a function to delete an existing task from the in-memory Todo list by ID. This is the second basic level feature for Phase I, enabling users to remove tasks.

## Data Model
Reference: specs/data_model.md (shared across features)
- Class: Task
  - id: int (unique identifier for deletion)
  - title: str
  - description: str
  - completed: bool

The in-memory storage is a list[Task] in the main app module, shared with other features.

## Requirements
- Command: 'delete <id>' (CLI input parsing, id as integer)
- Validate ID exists in list; if not, handle gracefully
- Remove task from list
- Output confirmation: "Task deleted: ID {id} - {title}"
- Integrate with existing list (remove by index or ID match)

## Quality Gates (per Constitution Principle 5)
- Type-safe with full hints (e.g., def delete_task(tasks: list[Task], task_id: int) -> None)
- Error handling: Raise ValueError if ID not found, print user-friendly message (e.g., "Task ID not found")
- Clean code: PEP 8, efficient removal (O(n) ok for small list), docstring for function
- Testable: Function modifies list in place but is idempotent if ID missing

## Agent Usage (per Constitution Principle 2)
- Generated by Spec Orchestrator Agent, refined by Spec Refiner Subagent
- Invoke skill validate_spec to check completeness before code generation

## Implementation Notes for Claude Code
- Use Python 3.13+, no external deps
- Assume tasks list is passed as param (for modularity)
- Refine this spec if Claude output is incorrect

This spec is approved for code generation.

## Response snapshot

Generated a feature specification for "Delete Task" for Phase I (In-Memory). The spec defines user stories for deleting tasks by ID, edge cases (invalid ID format, duplicate deletion, empty list), and functional requirements for validation and removal. A quality checklist was created at `specs/002-delete-task/checklists/requirements.md` confirming all criteria are met.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Progressive evolution enabled by designing deletion to map to a database DELETE in Phase II.
- 🧪 Tests: Acceptance scenarios defined for valid and invalid deletion attempts.
- 📁 Files: specs/002-delete-task/spec.md, specs/002-delete-task/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to design implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Edge case analysis revealed the need for explicit idempotency handling for duplicate deletions.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implementation planning with ID-based lookup optimization.
